# Stock Market Prediction using time-series forecasting on an LSTM model

Goal: Predict day-to-day changes in the stock market and display relevant information in a browser interface.

Method used: Time-series forecast with an RNN and an LSTM.

Frameworks:
- Alpaca API: Real-time prediction and analysis
- YFinance API: Model training and evaluation
- Socket.IO: Real-time system communication

Sample Prediction:
The following was taken from my model training page where I fed my model data ranging from 2012-2024. This data was in the form of the stock prices for IBIT (an ETF of Bitcoin) in which I accurately predicted the resulting trends that appeared in 2025.
